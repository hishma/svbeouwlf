Exiting Tsehum Harbour. Squalls continue to pass though, dark and ominous clouds continue to roll in from the west. Growing concerned about this weather and our late start. Considering a return to Sydney for the night if conditions worsen. 

Plotting a course past Coal Island into Prevost Passage. Engine running well. Will gage progress for another hour and reconsider.
