Freshly showered, fully caffeinated, muffinated, and with batteries recharged from the fist nights of gently rocking sleep aboard, and a healthy dose of shore power for all the various electonica, we are slipping out of Poets Cove bound for Friday harbor and the ol' US of A.

Day 2 begins. Engine on. A fresh breeze awaits.
