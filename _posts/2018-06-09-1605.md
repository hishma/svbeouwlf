Departed Westport Marina in Sidney B.C., Beowulf's home port until today. 

Numerous squalls have passed through for the last few hours, bringing rain and gusts as we prepared the boat for her journey to Seattle. A trip that we anticipate will take five days over two weekends.

Topped off fuel. Engine on (223.8 hrs).
