Across Prevost Passage now. Point Fairfax, on the SE tip of Moresby Island, lies off our port beam; Turn Point on Stuart Island, to starboard. Brethor, Domville, Gooch, Forest, and Sydney Islands are behind us, along with a number of smaller island, reefs and a whole lot of other navigation hazards. To the southeast we can see all the way down Haro Straight.

We are temporarily in U.S. waters as we pass between the southern Canadian Gulf Islands and the San Juan Islands. Beowulf, the reluctant emigrant,  doesn't seem to notice.

Making 5 knots under motor. Weather improving. Continuing on.
