Arrived at Poet's Cove on S Pender Island. 

With Grendel still deflated and tied to the foredeck, we decided to skip anchorign out or using a mooring ball and pay for a slip. It didn't hurt that the resort restaurant was open until 9pm. Nice soft landing for our first day out. Found out later that moorage included access to the pool and hot tub!
