__Beowulf__ is a 1978 [Marieholm 26](http://www.solopublications.com/sailmarie26.htm) made in Sweden, and named after the legendary [Geatish hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf_(hero)) in the eponymous [epic poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf) of the same name. She was designed by Tord Sundén as an update of the International Folkboat (A.K.A. IF boat), which in turn was based on the original [Nordic Folkboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Folkboat).

John Vigor wrote a great article about Folkboats for Good Old Boat Magazine that you can read [here](http://www.clickbert.com/IFboat/techtips/vigor.html). And then there's the book [Folkboat Story: From Cult to Classic — The Renaissance of a Legend](https://www.alibris.com/Folkboat-Story-From-Cult-to-Classic-The-Renaissance-of-a-Legend-Dieter-Loibner/book/40120897?matches=15) by Dieter Loibner.

Her full specifications can be viewed [here](http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=385).

We found her in Vancouver Island's [Tsehum Harbor](https://marinas.com/view/harbor/5gt3ee_Tsehum_Harbour_BC_Canada) in 2018, where she had been lovingly cared for by her previous owners. Quite appropriately next to Curteis Point, the former home of [M. Wylie Blanchet](http://thecurveoftime.com/CurveOfTimeCapi.htm), author of [The Curve of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curve_of_Time) a classic of cruising literature in the region.

Today she continues to sail the waters of [Puget Sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puget_Sound) and the greater [Salish Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salish_Sea) from her home port in Seattle.
