S/V Beowulf is a 1978 [Marieholm 26](http://www.solopublications.com/sailmarie26.htm) made in Sweden. She was designed by Tord Sundén as an update of the International Folkboat (A.K.A. IF boat), which in turn were based on the original [Nordic Folkboat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Folkboat).

John Vigor wrote a great article about Folkboats for Good Old Boat Magazine that you can read [here](http://www.clickbert.com/IFboat/techtips/vigor.html).

And then there's the book [Folkboat Story: From Cult to Classic — The Renaissance of a Legend](https://www.alibris.com/Folkboat-Story-From-Cult-to-Classic-The-Renaissance-of-a-Legend-Dieter-Loibner/book/40120897?matches=15) by Dieter Loibner.
