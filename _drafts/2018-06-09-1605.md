Departed Westport Marina in Sidney B.C., Beowulf's home port until today. Weather dodgy. Wind variable and gusty.

Numerous squalls have passed through for the last few hours, bringing rain and gusts as we prepared the boat for her journey to Seattle. A trip that we anticipate will take five days over two weekends.

The first leg will get us to Anacortes where we will leave Beowulf for a week. Along the way we have to import her into the US through customs. The following weekend we will journey from Anacortes all the way to her future home port just south of Seattle. Thats the rough plan anyway. The weather, wind, tides, current, customs officials, Neptune, and Beowulf herself will ultimately determine where we wind up and when. 

This whole thing is quite unexpected. This is just the first year of a five year plan. That plan — the plan — leads to a larger boat, longer voyages and grander ambitions. But three weeks ago Beowulf appeared. It was the first morning back  after five days of sailing. The computer screen was swaying back and forth in the gentle rythm that doesn't actually exist now that I'm on land. I briefly considered popping a Dramamine. Trying to get my head back into work after days away, I particpated in that favorite ritual of arm chair sailors everywhere, perusing the internet boat ads. I pulled up my first of a handul of saved searches, this one for "folkboat". Usually this results in half a dozen boats for sale in places like Estonia, Italy, and of course the UK. Oh and one brand newly constructed tradtiaonl folkboat built by the students of the [Northwest School of Wooden Boat Building](https://www.nwswb.edu) in nearby Port Hadlock. That of course is a beautiful boat, but far too expensive for boat 1.0.

Topped off fuel. Engine on (223.8 hrs).
